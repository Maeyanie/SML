Format spec:

File:
char[4] magic ("STC1")
int32 crc (crc32 of all the data in the file, not including the first 8 bytes)
<Data segment...>

Data segment:
uint8 type
uint32 length
<Length bytes of data>

Types:
0: Comment
	length bytes of undefined data
1: Vertex list
	(length/12) entry list of: float x, y, z
2: Double-precision vertex list
	(length/24) entry list of: double x, y, z
3: Triangle list
	(length/12) entry list of: uint32 a, b, c
	Entries are the index of a vertex in the most recent vertex list (type 1 or 2)
4: Quad list
	(length/16) entry list of: uint32 a, b, c, d
	Entries are the index of a vertex in the most recent vertex list (type 1 or 2)
5: Triangle strip
	First triangle (12 bytes): uint32 a, b, c
	Successive triangles (4 bytes) use the previous 2 points plus: uint32 n
	Entries are the index of a vertex in the most recent vertex list (type 1 or 2)

Notes:
- Normals are done by vertex order, matching the STL format.
